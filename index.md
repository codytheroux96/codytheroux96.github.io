# Cody Theroux's Professional ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio, showcasing my journey and growth throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU. This portfolio represents the culmination of my academic experience and demonstrates my proficiency in software development, algorithms and data structures, and database management.

Working through the Computer Science program while continuing ​my career​ as a backend engineer ​has been one of the most​ valuable ​experiences I​ ​have had​ so far. I originally returned to school because I wanted a stronger foundation behind the work I was already doing every day. Over time, the coursework and the ePortfolio pushed me to grow in ways that directly shaped my strengths, my goals, and even how I define my values as an engineer. The program helped me understand that I want to stay in backend engineering and systems work, but I want to approach it with more intention and better reasoning. Having the chance to build real projects while also studying algorithms, databases, and security filled in the gaps between what I learned on the job and the formal knowledge needed to move forward in this field. 

Throughout the program, I had to collaborate in different formats. Some classes required group discussion, others asked for peer feedback, and many assignments simulated communicating requirements to a specific audience. This helped me practice the kind of communication I already rely on at work when talking with stakeholders or walking someone through a technical decision. It showed me how important clarity is, especially in situations where the people I am explaining something to are not developers. I also strengthened my ability to justify design choices through documentation, which has carried into my day-to-day work when writing proposals or reviewing system changes. 

The technical coursework pushed me the most. Data structures and algorithms helped me think about performance in a more disciplined way instead of relying on intuition alone. This came through when building and refining complex features like my LRU cache and concurrency patterns. Database management and software engineering gave me the structure to design services that are easier to maintain and reason about. Security classes shifted how I design APIs and handle edge cases. I now assume that every service needs to be built with security in mind from the start, even if the project seems simple. All of these pieces have influenced my professional identity as someone who cares about reliability, clarity, and long-term stability. 

Building my ePortfolio brought everything together in one place, even though I chose to focus on a single artifact. My Go reverse proxy started as a simple local project that I built earlier on in my backend journey. At the time, it only needed to forward requests, and I never pushed it beyond that point. Revisiting it for the capstone forced me to look at it with fresh eyes and treat it like something that needed to be production grade. I enjoyed taking a project that once felt basic and transforming it into something far more capable. Adding features like routing logic through a dynamic registry, retries with backoff, rate limiting, caching, concurrency controls, and better structure showed me how much I have grown. Enhancing the proxy helped me apply what I learned in algorithms, security, and software engineering in a practical way. It also gave me the chance to build something that actually reflects the type of backend work I care about and want to keep doing.
